=head1 NAME

Sub::Clone - Clone subroutine refs for garbage collection/blessing purposes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Sub::Clone;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A surprising fact about Perl is that anonymous subroutines that do not close
over variables are actually shared, and do not garbage collect until global
destruction:

	sub get_callback {
		return sub { "hi!" };
	}

	my $first = get_callback();
	my $second = get_callback();

	warn "$first == $second"; # prints the same refaddr

This means that blessing such a sub would change all other copies (since they
are, in fact, not copies at all), and that C<DESTROY> will never be called.

=head1 PURE PERL VS XS

This module is implemented in both XS and pure Perl, and the reference counting
behavior of the two is slightly different.

The XS implementation of C<clone_sub> uses C<cv_clone> internally, the function
that captures closure state into a clone of the code ref struct (sharing the
optree etc), which means that it's a real clone (the prototype's reference
count does not go up), whereas the pure Perl version must wrap the proto.

This means that in the pure Perl version C<DESTROY> might not be called as
early for the cloned sub as the XS version.

=head1 VERSION CONTROL

This module is maintained using Darcs. You can get the latest version from
L<http://nothingmuch.woobling.org/code>, and use C<darcs send> to commit
changes.
